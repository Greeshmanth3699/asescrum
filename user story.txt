Creating a movie ticket online payment system involves multiple user stories, as it's a complex application with various functionalities. Here's a high-level user story that covers the main features of the system:

User Story: Movie Ticket Online Payment System

As a user:

Registration and Login:

I want to register for an account using my email and password.
I want to log in with my registered credentials.
Browsing Movies:

I want to browse a list of available movies.
I want to see details for each movie, such as title, genre, rating, and showtimes.
Selecting Movie and Showtime:

I want to select a movie from the list.
I want to choose a showtime for the selected movie.
Seat Selection:

I want to view a seating layout for the chosen showtime.
I want to select available seats for myself and my group.
I want to see the price for the selected seats.
Adding to Cart:

I want to add the selected seats to my cart.
I want to see an overview of my cart with the selected movie, showtime, seats, and total cost.

I want to proceed to payment securely.
I want to enter my payment details, such as credit/debit card information.
Confirmation:

I want to receive a booking confirmation with details of my purchase.
I want to see a summary of my booking, including movie, showtime, seats, and total cost.

I want to view my booking history, including past and upcoming bookings.
Profile Management:

I want to update my profile information, including name, email, and password.
Logout:

HTML and CSS:

For a complete HTML and CSS implementation of the user interface, including the registration, login, movie selection, seat booking, payment, and confirmation pages, the code would be quite extensive. It's beyond the scope of a single response.

Consider breaking down the development into manageable parts and use a front-end framework like React or Angular for building dynamic user interfaces. Additionally, integrate this front-end with a back-end system to handle user authentication, movie data, payment processing, and booking confirmation.
